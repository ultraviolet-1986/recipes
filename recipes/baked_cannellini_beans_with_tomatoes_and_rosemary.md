# Baked Cannellini Beans with Tomatoes and Rosemary

## Ingredients

- 2 tbsp unsalted butter
- 1 large white onion, diced
- ½ tsp dried thyme
- ½ tsp dried basil
- 2 tbsp tomato paste
- 2 x 410g cans cooked cannellini beans
- 40g shredded smoked mozzarella cheese

- 2 tbsp olive oil, plus extra for greasing the baking pan
- 4 cloves garlic, minced
- ½ tsp dried oregano
- ½ tsp fine sea salt
- 1 x 400g can chopped tomatoes
- 65g shredded Parmesan cheese
- 1 sprig fresh rosemary, leaves finely chopped

## Method

1. Preheat the oven to 180ºC/fan 170ºC/gas mark 4.
2. In a large, heavy-bottomed pot on medium-high heat, add the butter and olive oil. When the butter is melted, add the onions, garlic, thyme, oregano, basil, and salt and cook for about five minutes, until the onions begin to soften and become transparent. Add the tomato paste and chopped tomatoes and reduce heat to low; continue to cook uncovered for 10 minutes. Remove from heat.
3. Lightly grease the bottom and sides of an ovenproof dish with olive oil. Stir the beans into the tomato sauce until evenly combined. Pour the tomato and bean mixture into the dish. Sprinkle half the Parmesan and all the mozzarella evenly over the beans. Cover in aluminum foil and bake for 15 minutes.
4. Remove from oven and take off aluminum foil, then increase the oven temperature to 240ºC/fan 220ºC/gas mark 9. Add remaining Parmesan cheese to the dish and bake for five minutes more, or until mixture is golden and bubbly. Garnish with the fresh rosemary to serve.
