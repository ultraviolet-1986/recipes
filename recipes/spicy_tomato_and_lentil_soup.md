# Spicy Tomato and Lentil Soup

## Ingredients

- 1x finely chopped red onion
- 1x grated garlic clove
- 750ml vegetable stock
- 1x tin of chopped tomatoes
- 1tsp paprika, cayenne pepper, and piri-piri seasoning
- 1/4tsp chilli powder
- 1/3 tube of tomato purée
- 200g red lentils

## Preparation

The chopped onion and garlic should be placed in a lightly-oiled pan to fry
until golden - during this time, prepare the vegetable stock and pour into the
pan once ingredients are golden.

Once the stock, onion, and garlic have been thoroughly mixed, pour in the
chopped tomatoes and tomato purée and stir thoroughly. At this point, the
paprika, cayenne pepper, piri-piri, and chilli powder should be added. Allow the
mixture to settle for a moment on a medium-low temperature after stirring
thoroughly.

With all ingredients added and mixed, it is time to add the lentils. At this
stage, the temperature should be lowered slightly to allow the soup to gently
bubble and allow the lentils to soften. When the lentils have softened, ensure
the soup is not too thick - add a small amount of water to get the soup to the
preferred consistency.

Leave the mixture thickened and add single portion to a handful of grated cheese
and 100g cooked pasta for a quick makeshift lentil bolognese.
